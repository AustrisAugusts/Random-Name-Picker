# Random Name Picker
Random Name Picker is a small JavaScript project I created while learning the language. Simple project based on JavaScript knowledge I have earned by compleating an online course section. 
It's design is taken from an existing course I'm taking now on Udemy. I did change some of it to fit my little project. 


#### In the folder:
  - 4 files, including index.html , style.css, script.js and readme.md

For my _Random Name Picker_ project I have used JavaScript arrays, methods and functions for the main functionality as well some basic html and css for visual purposes.

### How to use it
